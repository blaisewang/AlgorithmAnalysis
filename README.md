My Algorithm Analysis Lesson Lab Work


## Lab 1
Insertion Sort and Merge Sort


## Lab 2
Quick Sort and Find N'th Smallest Element in Unsorted Array


Beside this, I did some minor work to compare the efficiency of Quick Sort and Merge Sort (The efficiency of Insertion Sort is too low to compare with these two sort methods)
 with [JFreeChart](https://github.com/jfree/jfreechart).

So you need to import [JFreeChart](https://github.com/jfree/jfreechart) libraries before compile the project.

## Lab 3
The Solution to Maximum SubArray problem and its sum with time complexity O(n)


## Lab 4
Get Longest Common Subsequence from two strings and the length of LCS.
Calculate the distance between string A and string B.


## Lab 5
Solve matrix chain multiplication problem by dynamic programming.
Given a sequence of matrices and get the most efficient way to multiply these matrices.
