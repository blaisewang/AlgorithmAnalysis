# AlgorithmAnalysis
My Algorithm Analysis Lesson Lab Work


## Lab 1
Insertion Sort and Merge Sort


## Lab 2
Quick Sort and Find N'th Smallest Element in Unsorted Array


Beside this, I did some minor work to compare the efficiency of Quick Sort and Merge Sort with [JFreeChart](https://github.com/jfree/jfreechart).
So you need to import [JFreeChart](https://github.com/jfree/jfreechart) libraries before compile the project.




## Lab 3
The Solution to Maximum Subarray Problem and its sum with Time complexity O(n)
